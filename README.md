In this program I hope to learn to apply machine learning concepts in the real world and use the skills I learn to build cool projects that can be implemented in daily life. I also hope to meet and connect with a diverse group of people who have gone through different experiences in the computer science realm so I could learn from them and get advice from them that could help me as I get deeper into the computer science realm myself. Along with this, I hope to work on my career skills by developing my resume and Github to set myself up for applying to internships and jobs in the future.
