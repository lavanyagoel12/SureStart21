In this program I hope to learn to apply machine learning concepts in the real world and use the skills I learn to build cool projects that can be implemented in daily life. I also hope to meet and connect with a diverse group of people who have gone through different experiences in the computer science realm so I could learn from them and get advice from them that could help me as I get deeper into the computer science realm myself. Along with this, I hope to work on my career skills by developing my resume and Github to set myself up for applying to internships and jobs in the future.

The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that in unsupervised learning, the model has to find patterns and relationships in the data on its own, but in supervised lerning, the data is pre-defined so the model can check how accurate it is in comparision to the actual values.
The statement that Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries is false because Scikit-Learn has to use these libraries in order to create visualizations for data. It works with these different libraries and implements code from them in order to create data visuals, without them, the visuals wouldn't work.

Tensors are basically mathematical representations of physical objects that can be characterized by magnitude and multiple directions (such as in the x, y, and z planes). In Machine Learning, tensors are used to represent an array of numbers in 3-dimensional space.  
In the interactive models in the TensorFlow tutorial, I noticed that many of the components had to be created first as placeholders, and then were later filled and adjusted by the specific data we were working with.

This is a dataset I found with characteristics related to depression: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/the-depression-dataset  
It could be used to detect depression states in people based on patterns between these characteristics. I would likely use a convolutional neural network to develop this. A CNN could look at groups of characteristics related to depression, and then combine the results from the groups to output a final answer of which depression state was detected.

Tried this model, worked fine. Didn't create my own (not quite sure how to do that...), just played around with this one. I'm going to continue to try to figure out creating my own though.
